      <h2>Aiden Barnardiston</h2>
      <p>Heir of the Barnardiston estate, a medium small fief. His family are farmers, but he has a particular love for books. He cares for animals and is thus vegetarian. His love for books led him to learn the art of creating seals - magical sequences that could be stored in physical objects. His power with making seals is what caught the Academy's attention and earned him a place as a student there.</p>

      <h2>Iropa Academy</h2>
      <p>A magical school built in the clouds, the Academy was built to train the brightest and most gifted children of the world of Iropa, to make them a form of planetary defence against invaders. As such, the Academy does not involve itself with concerns of race, religion or government and accepts anyone who shows talent regardless of background.</p>

    <h2>Day 1</h2>

    <p>Aiden and Venus are both freshman at Iropa Academy in the same batch. After the opening ceremony, Aiden is walking the grounds when he notices a rare bird he has never seen before. He follows the bird, careful to not be seen and is led to a remote reed swamp. The bird has a mysterious cloaking ability but Aiden has a compas that can overrule it. Suddenly the bird gets caught in a trap and Venus jumps out to catch the bird. Aiden tries to interfere, saying it is his bird but venus says she caught it. aiden says she could only catch it because he used his compass to unmask its cloaking. venus says that they obviouslt worked together so they can have half each. aiden doesnt understand until he sees but Venus kill it and disect it. he is horrified and says it is a rare bird. She says thats all the more reason to disect it, to see how it works inside. Plus it looks yummy and lunch is still hours away.  Venus  then pulls out a small crystal from the bird. As soon as Aiden sees the crystal his eyes go wide. It is full of seals and he loves seals. He grabs the crystal and tells Venus she can eat the whole bird as he is vegetarian. Venus is intrigued and asks why he likes the crystal so much. Aiden doesnt want to say at first, but after badgering by Venus he tells her that he is fascinated by seals, and he noticed that this crystal is packed full of naturally occuring seals. If he can study it he could learn how to create new ones.</p>
    <p>Venus asks what seals are as she starts cooking the bird. Aiden explains they are small traces of magic left behind in a place which can do various thing. As an example, he takes a small rock and infuses some seals on it, then throws it to her and asks her to try and break the rock. Venus tries hard, but she cant. She is amazed and asks if he could use this trick to make armour. He says hed never thought of that before. He just uses the seals to protect his gardens and farmlands from predators and the environment. Venus pulls out a pile of feathers she plucked from the bird and asks Aiden if he can do the same trick to the feathers. He says he can but it will take some time. Venus says she can promise to bring him more of those kinds of crystals if he does it for her, so he agrees.</p>
    <p>In the first assembly the freshmen are told that there will be an opening assessment to dictate all their ranks. The students can form groups of between one and four and will then need to face of against various puppet monsters to determine their ranks. Venus asks Aiden if he has anyone he wants to group up with and he says hes not very interested in the ranking, he just wants to study seals. Venus tries to convince him to join group with her, but he says she can probably find someone stronger. He doesnt mind if he fails. Venus leaves frustrated, saying she has something to do.</p>
    <p>Late at night Aiden sits in his room overlooking a lake with the reflection of the moon. He looks at the crystal and starts studying the seals. He notices the seals contain some kind of illusion magic which makes the bird able to camoflague itself. As he is studying the seal, he starts placing seals on the bird feathers as Venus asked, absentmindedly trying to infuse the camoflague seal as well.</p>

    <h2>Day 2</h2>
    <p>The next day Venus meets Aiden early and asks if hes finished the feather. he gives them to her. she inspects them then tells him she's got an interesting crystal of a lizard that can breathe fire and gives him a larger pile of feathers. He says it will take a few nights and she agrees, giving him the crystal. She also tells him she found a library full of seals, and that he should go have a look if there are any he is interested in learning. Then she disappears.</p>
    <p>Aiden goes to look at the library and finda there are indeed some books on seals among the other books. However the books he can access only have details on low level seals he can already perform. The library is divided into levels and the higher books are in the higher levels. When he asks how he can view books in the higher levels he is told it is based on reputation points. Students who do valuable tasks for the academy get reputation points, and one of the easiest ways to get reputation points is to get a high ranking in the upcoming assessment. Aiden starts to realise the assessment might be useful afterall.</p>
    <p>In the morning assessment Aiden finds Venus and tells her he changed his mind and asks if she still wants to team up with her. Venus grins, saying she knew it, and immediatelt agrees. Then he says that to get higher ranking its better to form a group of four. Venus agrees but says she doesnt know many other people. Aiden says he will talk to some others and get back to her.</p>

      <h2>Brute Bloodworth</h2>
      <p>Heir to Bloodworth Mountain, Brute's family own a large mountain range full of mines and smiths producing top quality iron. He is very strong and works on improving his body through pressure and elemental infusion. His body has a slight grey tinge from being infused with iron. Brute is not smart but works hard and singlemindedly to achieve his goals.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="character">
      <h2>Maeve Vannoy</h2>
      <p>Duchess of Vannoy valley, Maeve's family owns a twisting misty valley that produces all kinds of mysterious goods including medicines, poisons and cosmetics. Maeve is quiet and keeps to herself. She has long unkempt hair and wears a brutish looking cloak that makes her look wild and unapproachable. Despite this appearance, Maeve is quite romantic and secret hopes for a prince that will one day come and take her away.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Aiden doesnt actually have many friends outside his family farm. As he is walking through the campus he comes across a noticeboard with missions and requests on it. He notices two small notes to one corner of people looking for a team to join. One is a boy called Brute and the other a girl names Maeve. Aiden decides to go and befriend them and ask them to join their group.</p>
    <p>That night, at dinner time, Aiden finds Venus and brings with him Brute and Maeve. Venus is shocked when she seems them. Both of them look like oddballs. Brute asks if she is the fourth member of their group. Venus corrects them that she is the first and Aiden is second. That makes the two of them third and fourth. Maeve shrugs and says she just wants to clear rank one so she can get something she wants. She doesnt care if they join her as long as they dont get in her way. Brute agrees this is the best way to work together. Venus frowns but agrees that four is better than tso no matter what, and so it is settled.</p>
    <p>That night Aiden sits in his room and looks at the crystal from the lizard as he works on making Venus' seals. As he contemplates the upcoming assessment he realises he doesn't really have any offensive abilities. He peruses that perhaps this fire breathing lizard is the key to giving him something he can fight with. As he looks at the crystal his eyes light up. It is indeed a seal for performing fire based magic.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, in another room overlooking a misty valley bathed in purple moonlight, Venus sits in front of a mirror, sewing. She lifts up a little crown she has made from bird feathers and taps it with her fingers. As hoped, ripples appear in the air around the feather, blocking her from using more than the smallest amount of force on them. She smiles happily and places the crown on her head. Suddenly she stands up with shock. When she looks in the mirror she can see her whole person except her head. Its as if a wall of fog is hiding her head from view. Is this invisibility? She asks herself, remembering the strange behaviour of the bird she caught. Aiden, it looks like youve outdone yourself, she bemuses.</p>

    <h2>Day 3</h2>

    <p>The next day Aiden goes to the library. He is not allowed to look at the books on the other levels, but he can gaze at the titles. On the first level are a bunch of books on seals that can do basic things like sharpen stones and drill holes. On the second level were fewer books on things like levitating small objects. However the third level catches his attention. There is a book on seals for flight and pressure based projectiles. On the fifth level is a book on generating life. Aiden daydreams about flying around and decides he must have that book. Also the one about generating life resonates with him, but level 5 seems quite far away. Aiden decides he must do his best to get a high rank!</p>
    <p>At assembly there are more details given about the assessment. The fifth day would be the day of the assessment. </p>
    <p>Aiden meets Brute and discusses battle strategy with him. Brute says not too worry. He can handle most of the fighting because his body is like a rock - literally. He is infused with stones from his family mine. He gives Aiden some small black rocks as a gift.
    <p>Next Aiden visits Maeve. Her home is full of plants which makes Aiden feel happy. But then she shows him how to poison an animal from a distance and he freaks out. Maeve gives him a special lotion and asks him to apply it to his skin every day, saying it will make his stronger. Aiden takes the gift but feels suspicious and doesnt use it.
    <p>Finally Aiden visits Venus. He asks her how she fights. She shows him her blade and says she is skilled at disecting things. He doesnt ask for a demonstration, but tells her he is worried. He doesnt know how to fight. Venus says not to worry. If he can create some shields with his seals, it should be fine.
    <p>That night, Aiden sits in his room looking at the fire crystal seals. 'The cloaking seal worked by changing the way light bounces off it. Instead of causing light to bounce off the seal, it causes light to bounce around it. It would cause a ray of light coming toward a seal to appear to pass right through it, giving it the illusion of invisibility. This fire seal however.. seems to work by covering over black stones stored in the lizard's body. The seal causes those stones to spin super fast, and when they react with the air, fire is born. The faster the stone spins, the greater the reaction. It would seem the type of stone used is also important.' Aiden pulls out the small black stones Brute had given him. The stones leave a black sooty substance on his hand when he touches them. Aiden creates a seal on one of the stones and throws it out the window. Instantly the stone bursts into flame before falling into the lake and being smothered out. Black smoke pours from the lake causing other students to look over in surprise. Aiden smiles. He has found a way to fight.

Day 4
---

The next day are no classes. Students can prepare for the assessment. Aiden asks his team to gather together to try fighting. There are some rocks in a canyon. Brute goes up to one rock and punches it hard. The whole rock cracks and falls to smitherines. Next Maeve throws a potion at another rock. Blackish purple smoke pours out of the rock and it begins melting. Then it is Venus' turn. She jumps at the rock, swinging her blade, and cuts the rock in two with a diagonal strike. The three of them look at each other with approval. Finally Aiden steps forward. He takes out one of the black rocks Brute had given him. Then he activates a seal and throws it. The rock bursts into flame before landing on a stone and engulfing the stone in flame. when the flame dies out the stone is charred black and the top half of it disolves into black ash. Venus looks at Aiden with an excited glint in her eyes. Brute is also impressed and hands Aiden a large sack full of black stones.

She proposes an attack strategy. Her and Brute are best at taking down hard armoured enemies. Maeve and Aiden would be best against organic enemies. Maeve would also focus on healing while Aiden focuses on using shields. As such, Brutus can take up a defensive position at the front and Venus an offensive. Maeve and Aiden would support from behind. The group agree on the plan and each split off to work on their own abilities.

Aiden give the remaining feathers to Venus. She accepts them happily and they all go their separate ways.
 That night Aiden works hard on making seals for his black stones. He experiments with increasing the heat and power of the blast. Venus finished a feathered robe. When she puts it on in the mirror, her whole body disappears.
